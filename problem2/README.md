# Array Initialization and Access Syntax Checker
Build a syntax checker that validates array initialization and
access in a simple programming language. The syntax checker will verify the correctness of
array declarations, initializations, and element access expressions.

## Requirements
* [Python] 3.11 and above

## Instructions to Run it
1. Download the project file `3110-TrafficLight-main.zip`
1. Open the Terminal of your operating System
1. Locate and navigate to the directory where files are located
    - e.g. `cd downloads/3110-TrafficLight-main`
1. Run the project using `python ArrayInitialization.py`

## Running the Project
1. After executing users will be asked to declare and initialize an array accepted by [Java]:
```bash
*NOTE* Please separate instructions by a semi-colon and a space (e.g., int arr[2]; arr = {1, 2}; arr[0] = 0).
Please declare an array, populate the array, then change the value of a random index (or type 'exit' to quit): int arr[5]; arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; arr[2] = 10;

Please declare an array, populate the array, then change the value of a random index (or type 'exit' to quit):
```
2. The program will check the user's input until `exit` is entered
```bash
*NOTE* Please separate instructions by a semi-colon and a space (e.g., int arr[2]; arr = {1, 2}; arr[0] = 0).
Please declare an array, populate the array, then change the value of a random index (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting the program.
