# Traffic Light Controller System
The system will control traffic flow at an intersection, manage the transition between Red, Yellow, 
and Green states, and include priority handling for emergency vehicles. When an emergency vehicle is 
detected, the system should override the normal operation, immediately giving the green light to the
direction where the emergency vehicle is approaching.

## Requirements
* [Python] 3.11 and above

## Instructions to Run it
1. Download the project file `3110-TrafficLight-main.zip`
1. Open the Terminal of your operating System
1. Locate and navigate to the directory where files are located
    - e.g. `cd downloads/3110-TrafficLight-main`
1. Run the project using `python ArrayInitialization.py`

## Running the Project
1. After executing users will be asked to declare and initialize an array accepted by [Java]:
```bash
*NOTE* Please separate instructions by a semi-colon and a space (e.g., int arr[2]; arr = {1, 2}; arr[0] = 0).
Please declare an array, populate the array, then change the value of a random index (or type 'exit' to quit): int arr[5]; arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; arr[2] = 10;

```
2. The program will check the user's input until `exit` is entered
```bash
*NOTE* Please separate instructions by a semi-colon and a space (e.g., int arr[2]; arr = {1, 2}; arr[0] = 0).
Please declare an array, populate the array, then change the value of a random index (or type 'exit' to quit): exit
Exiting the program.
